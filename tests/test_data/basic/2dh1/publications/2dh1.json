Each subunit has essentially the same characteristic tertiary fold that is found in other legume lectins. The structure, however, exhibits an unusual quaternary arrangement of subunits. Unlike other well-characterized tetrameric proteins with identical subunits, peanut lectin has neither 222 (D2) nor fourfold (C4) symmetry. A noncrystallographic twofold axis relates two halves of the molecule. The two monomers in each half are related by a local twofold axis. The mutual disposition of the axes is such that they do not lead to a closed point group. Furthermore, the structure of peanut lectin demonstrates that differences in subunit arrangement in legume lectins could be due to factors intrinsic to the protein molecule and, contrary to earlier suggestions, are not necessarily caused by interactions involving covalently linked sugar. The structure provides a useful framework for exploring the structural basis and the functional implications of the variability in the subunit arrangement in legume lectins despite all of them having nearly the same subunit structure, and also for investigating the general problem of \"open\" quaternary assembly in oligomeric proteins."},"author_list":[{"full_name":"Banerjee R","last_name":"Banerjee","initials":"R"},{"full_name":"Mande SC","last_name":"Mande","initials":"SC"},{"full_name":"Ganesh V","last_name":"Ganesh","initials":"V"},{"full_name":"Das K","last_name":"Das","initials":"K"},{"full_name":"Dhanaraj V","last_name":"Dhanaraj","initials":"V"},{"full_name":"Mahanta SK","last_name":"Mahanta","initials":"SK"},{"full_name":"Suguna K","last_name":"Suguna","initials":"K"},{"full_name":"Surolia A","last_name":"Surolia","initials":"A"},{"full_name":"Vijayan M","last_name":"Vijayan","initials":"M"}]},{"doi":"10.1006/jmbi.1996.0319","title":"Conformation, protein-carbohydrate interactions and a novel subunit association in the refined structure of peanut lectin-lactose complex.","pubmed_id":"8656429","type":"J","associated_entries":"1v6i, 1v6j, 1v6k, 1v6l, 1v6m, 1v6n, 1v6o, 2pel","journal_info":{"pdb_abbreviation":"J.

The subunit conformation in the structure is similar to that in other legume lectins except in the loops. It has been shown that in the tertiary structure of legume lectins, the short five-stranded sheet plays a major role in connecting the larger flat six-stranded and curved seven-stranded sheets. Furthermore, the loops that connect the strands at the two ends of the seven-stranded sheet curve toward and interact with each other to produce a second hydrophobic core in addition to the one between the two large sheets. The protein-lactose interactions involve the invariant features observed in other legume lectins in addition to those characteristic of peanut lectin. The \"open\" quaternary association in peanut lectin is stabilised by hydrophobic, hydrogen-bonded and water-mediated interactions. Contrary to the earlier belief, the structure of peanut lectin demonstrates that the variability in quaternary association in legume lectins, despite all of them having nearly the same tertiary structure, is not necessarily caused by covalently bound carbohydrate. An attempt has been made to provide a structural rationale for this variability, on the basis of buried surface areas during dimerisation. A total of 45 water molecules remain invariant when the hydration shells of the four subunits are compared. A majority of them appear to be involved in stabilising loops."},"author_list":[{"full_name":"Banerjee R","last_name":"Banerjee","initials":"R"},{"full_name":"Das K","last_name":"Das","initials":"K"},{"full_name":"Ravishankar R","last_name":"Ravishankar","initials":"R"},{"full_name":"Suguna K","last_name":"Suguna","initials":"K"},{"full_name":"Surolia A","last_name":"Surolia","initials":"A"},{"full_name":"Vijayan M","last_name":"Vijayan","initials":"M"}]},{"doi":null,"title":"The Specificity of Peanut Agglutinin for Thomsen-Friedenreich Antigen is Mediated by Water-Bridges","pubmed_id":null,"type":"J","associated_entries":"1v6i, 1v6j, 1v6k, 1v6l, 1v6m, 1v6n, 1v6o, 2pel","journal_info":{"pdb_abbreviation":"Curr.

It is now shown that it is possible to grow peanut lectin crystals at acidic pH in the presence of oligopeptides corresponding to a loop in the lectin molecule. Crystals have also been prepared in the presence of these peptides as well as lactose. Low-pH crystal forms of the lectin-lactose complex similar to those obtained at neutral pH have also been grown. Thus, crystals of peanut lectin grown under different environmental conditions, at two pH values with and without sugar bound to the lectin, are now available. They have been used to explore the plasticity and hydration of the molecule. A detailed comparison between different structures shows that the lectin molecule is sturdy and that the effect of changes in pH, ligand binding and environment on it is small. The region involving the curved front beta-sheet and the loops around the second hydrophobic core is comparatively rigid. The back beta-sheet involved in quaternary association, which exhibits considerable variability, is substantially flexible, as is the sugar-binding region. The numbers of invariant water molecules in the hydration shell are small and they are mainly involved in metal coordination or in stabilizing unusual structural features. Small consistent movements occur in the combining site upon sugar binding, although the site is essentially preformed."},"author_list":[{"full_name":"Kundhavai Natchiar S","last_name":"Kundhavai Natchiar","initials":"S"},{"full_name":"Arockia Jeyaprakash A","last_name":"Arockia Jeyaprakash","initials":"A"},{"full_name":"Ramya TN","last_name":"Ramya","initials":"TN"},{"full_name":"Thomas CJ","last_name":"Thomas","initials":"CJ"},{"full_name":"Suguna K","last_name":"Suguna","initials":"K"},{"full_name":"Surolia A","last_name":"Surolia","initials":"A"},{"full_name":"Vijayan M","last_name":"Vijayan","initials":"M"}]},{"doi":"10.1021/ja0173066","title":"Photoswitchable multivalent sugar ligands: synthesis, isomerization, and lectin binding studies of azobenzene-glycopyranoside derivatives.","pubmed_id":"11878960","type":"J","associated_entries":"1v6i, 1v6j, 1v6k, 1v6l, 1v6m, 1v6n, 1v6o, 2pel","journal_info":{"pdb_abbreviation":"J.
