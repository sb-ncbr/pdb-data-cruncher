Cryogenic electron micrographs of a crystal edge showed the crystal to be made up of hollow spherical assemblies with a diameter of 250 A. X-ray diffraction data at 9.5 A resolution revealed the spherical shell of LHC-II to have icosahedral symmetry. A T = 1 icosahedral model of LHC-II, in which the stromal surface of the protein faces outward, was constructed using the previously reported structure of the LHC-II trimer [KÃ¼hlbrandt et al. (1994), Nature (London), 367, 614-621]. The present result shows the first example of a well ordered three-dimensional crystal of icosahedral proteoliposomes."},"author_list":[{"full_name":"Hino T","last_name":"Hino","initials":"T"},{"full_name":"Kanamori E","last_name":"Kanamori","initials":"E"},{"full_name":"Shen JR","last_name":"Shen","initials":"JR"},{"full_name":"Kouyama T","last_name":"Kouyama","initials":"T"}]}]}
