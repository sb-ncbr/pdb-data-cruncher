Its surfactant activity is intrinsic to the protein in its native form, and is manifest without associated lipids or glycosylation. Latherin probably functions as a wetting agent in evaporative cooling in horses, but it may also assist in mastication of fibrous food as well as inhibition of microbial biofilms. It is a member of the PLUNC family of proteins abundant in the oral cavity and saliva of mammals, one of which has also been shown to be a surfactant and capable of disrupting microbial biofilms. How these proteins work as surfactants while remaining soluble and cell membrane-compatible is not known. Nor have their structures previously been reported. We have used protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to determine the conformation and dynamics of latherin in aqueous solution. The protein is a monomer in solution with a slightly curved cylindrical structure exhibiting a 'super-roll' motif comprising a four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet and two opposing α-helices which twist along the long axis of the cylinder. One end of the molecule has prominent, flexible loops that contain a number of apolar amino acid side chains. This, together with previous biophysical observations, leads us to a plausible mechanism for surfactant activity in which the molecule is first localized to the non-polar interface via these loops, and then unfolds and flattens to expose its hydrophobic interior to the air or non-polar surface. Intrinsically surface-active proteins are relatively rare in nature, and this is the first structure of such a protein from mammals to be reported. Both its conformation and proposed method of action are different from other, non-mammalian surfactant proteins investigated so far."},"author_list":[{"full_name":"Vance SJ","last_name":"Vance","initials":"SJ"},{"full_name":"McDonald RE","last_name":"McDonald","initials":"RE"},{"full_name":"Cooper A","last_name":"Cooper","initials":"A"},{"full_name":"Smith BO","last_name":"Smith","initials":"BO"},{"full_name":"Kennedy MW","last_name":"Kennedy","initials":"MW"}]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0005726","title":"Latherin: a surfactant protein of horse sweat and saliva.","pubmed_id":"19478940","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"journal_info":{"pdb_abbreviation":"PLoS ONE","ISO_abbreviation":"PLoS One","pages":"e5726","volume":"4","issue":"5","year":2009},"abstract":{"background":null,"objective":null,"methods":null,"results":null,"conclusions":null,"unassigned":"Horses are unusual in producing protein-rich sweat for thermoregulation, a major component of which is latherin, a highly surface-active, non-glycosylated protein. The amino acid sequence of latherin, determined from cDNA analysis, is highly conserved across four geographically dispersed equid species (horse, zebra, onager, ass), and is similar to a family of proteins only found previously in the oral cavity and associated tissues of mammals. Latherin produces a significant reduction in water surface tension at low concentrations (< or = 1 mg ml(-1)), and therefore probably acts as a wetting agent to facilitate evaporative cooling through a waterproofed pelt. Neutron reflection experiments indicate that this detergent-like activity is associated with the formation of a dense protein layer, about 10 A thick, at the air-water interface. However, biophysical characterization (circular dichroism, differential scanning calorimetry) in solution shows that latherin behaves like a typical globular protein, although with unusual intrinsic fluorescence characteristics, suggesting that significant conformational change or unfolding of the protein is required for assembly of the air-water interfacial layer. RT-PCR screening revealed latherin transcripts in horse skin and salivary gland but in no other tissues. Recombinant latherin produced in bacteria was also found to be the target of IgE antibody from horse-allergic subjects. Equids therefore may have adapted an oral/salivary mucosal protein for two purposes peculiar to their lifestyle, namely their need for rapid and efficient heat dissipation and their specialisation for masticating and processing large quantities of dry food material."},"author_list":[{"full_name":"McDonald RE","last_name":"McDonald","initials":"RE"},{"full_name":"Fleming RI","last_name":"Fleming","initials":"RI"},{"full_name":"Beeley JG","last_name":"Beeley","initials":"JG"},{"full_name":"Bovell DL","last_name":"Bovell","initials":"DL"},{"full_name":"Lu JR","last_name":"Lu","initials":"JR"},{"full_name":"Zhao X","last_name":"Zhao","initials":"X"},{"full_name":"Cooper A","last_name":"Cooper","initials":"A"},{"full_name":"Kennedy MW","last_name":"Kennedy","initials":"MW"}]},{"doi":null,"title":"The Relationship between Structure and Function in Natural Surfactant Proteins","pubmed_id":null,"type":"Q","associated_entries":null,"journal_info":{"pdb_abbreviation":"Ph D Thesis","ISO_abbreviation":null,"pages":"-","volume":null,"issue":null,"year":2012},"abstract":{"background":null,"objective":null,"methods":null,"results":null,"conclusions":null,"unassigned":null},"author_list":[{"full_name":"Vance, S.J.","last_name":null,"initials":null}]}]}
