In the presence of ATP (or ATPgammaS), these proteins form helical filaments containing single-stranded DNA at the center. The single-stranded DNA bound to RecA protein is extended 1.5 times relative to B-form DNA with the same sequence, and the extension is critical to pairing with homologous double-stranded DNA. This pairing reaction, called homologous pairing, is a key reaction in homologous recombination. In this NMR study, we determined a three-dimensional structure of the single-stranded DNA bound to RecA protein. The DNA structure contains novel deoxyribose-base stacking in which the 2'-methylene moiety of each deoxyribose is placed above the base of the following residue, instead of normal stacking of adjacent bases. As a result of this deoxyribose-base stacking, bases of the single-stranded DNA are spaced out nearly 5 A. Thus, this novel structure well explains the axial extension of DNA in the RecA-filaments relative to B-form DNA and leads to a possible interpretation of the role of this extension in homologous pairing."},"author_list":[{"full_name":"Nishinaka T","last_name":"Nishinaka","initials":"T"},{"full_name":"Ito Y","last_name":"Ito","initials":"Y"},{"full_name":"Yokoyama S","last_name":"Yokoyama","initials":"S"},{"full_name":"Shibata T","last_name":"Shibata","initials":"T"}]}]}
