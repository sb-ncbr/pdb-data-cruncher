RIPK1 and RIPK3 associate through their RIP homotypic interaction motifs with consensus sequences IQIG (RIPK1) and VQVG (RIPK3). Using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, we determined the high-resolution structure of the RIPK1-RIPK3 core. RIPK1 and RIPK3 alternately stack (RIPK1, RIPK3, RIPK1, RIPK3, etc.) to form heterotypic β sheets. Two such β sheets bind together along a compact hydrophobic interface featuring an unusual ladder of alternating Ser (from RIPK1) and Cys (from RIPK3). The crystal structure of a four-residue RIPK3 consensus sequence is consistent with the architecture determined by NMR. The RIPK1-RIPK3 core is the first detailed structure of a hetero-amyloid and provides a potential explanation for the specificity of hetero- over homo-amyloid formation and a structural basis for understanding the mechanisms of signal transduction."},"author_list":[{"full_name":"Mompeán M","last_name":"Mompeán","initials":"M"},{"full_name":"Li W","last_name":"Li","initials":"W"},{"full_name":"Li J","last_name":"Li","initials":"J"},{"full_name":"Laage S","last_name":"Laage","initials":"S"},{"full_name":"Siemer AB","last_name":"Siemer","initials":"AB"},{"full_name":"Bozkurt G","last_name":"Bozkurt","initials":"G"},{"full_name":"Wu H","last_name":"Wu","initials":"H"},{"full_name":"McDermott AE","last_name":"McDermott","initials":"AE"}]}]}
