This sequence has the interesting property of pairing with itself to form stable duplexes. We have determined the solution structure of the unusual DNA duplex 5'-TGGAATGGAA:TGGAATGGAA-3' at atomic resolution. The duplex contains unpaired staggered guanosine residues, which co-stack by intercalation between sheared G.A and A.G base-pairs to form an interesting new structural motif, the GA-bracketed G-stack. The TGGAA repeat unit contains six \"steps\", four of which are not Watson-Crick base-pairs."},"author_list":[{"full_name":"Chou SH","last_name":"Chou","initials":"SH"},{"full_name":"Zhu L","last_name":"Zhu","initials":"L"},{"full_name":"Reid BR","last_name":"Reid","initials":"BR"}]}]}
