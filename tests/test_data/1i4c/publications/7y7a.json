The antenna systems of red algae consist of soluble phycobilisomes (PBSs) and transmembrane light-harvesting complexes (LHCs)<sub>3</sub>. Excitation energy transfer pathways from PBS to photosystems remain unclear owing to the lack of structural information. Here we present in situ structures of PBS-PSII-PSI-LHC megacomplexes from the red alga Porphyridium purpureum at near-atomic resolution using cryogenicÂ electron tomography and in situ single-particle analysis<sub>4</sub>, providing interaction details between PBS, PSII and PSI. The structures reveal several unidentified and incomplete proteins and their roles in the assembly of the megacomplex, as well as a huge and sophisticated pigment network. This work provides a solid structural basis for unravelling the mechanisms of PBS-PSII-PSI-LHC megacomplex assembly, efficient energy transfer from PBS to the two photosystems, and regulation of energy distribution between PSII and PSI."},"author_list":[{"full_name":"You X","last_name":"You","initials":"X"},{"full_name":"Zhang X","last_name":"Zhang","initials":"X"},{"full_name":"Cheng J","last_name":"Cheng","initials":"J"},{"full_name":"Xiao Y","last_name":"Xiao","initials":"Y"},{"full_name":"Ma J","last_name":"Ma","initials":"J"},{"full_name":"Sun S","last_name":"Sun","initials":"S"},{"full_name":"Zhang X","last_name":"Zhang","initials":"X"},{"full_name":"Wang HW","last_name":"Wang","initials":"HW"},{"full_name":"Sui SF","last_name":"Sui","initials":"SF"}]}]}
