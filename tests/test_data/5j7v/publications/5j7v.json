Here we describe the structure of faustovirus, the first DNA virus (to our knowledge) that has been found to use two protein shells to encapsidate and protect its genome. The crystal structure of the major capsid protein, in combination with cryo-electron microscopy structures of two different maturation stages of the virus, shows that the outer virus shell is composed of a double jelly-roll protein that can be found in many double-stranded DNA viruses. The structure of the repeating hexameric unit of the inner shell is different from all other known capsid proteins. In addition to the unique architecture, the region of the genome that encodes the major capsid protein stretches over 17,000 bp and contains a large number of introns and exons. This complexity might help the virus to rapidly adapt to new environments or hosts."},"author_list":[{"full_name":"Klose T","last_name":"Klose","initials":"T"},{"full_name":"Reteno DG","last_name":"Reteno","initials":"DG"},{"full_name":"Benamar S","last_name":"Benamar","initials":"S"},{"full_name":"Hollerbach A","last_name":"Hollerbach","initials":"A"},{"full_name":"Colson P","last_name":"Colson","initials":"P"},{"full_name":"La Scola B","last_name":"La Scola","initials":"B"},{"full_name":"Rossmann MG","last_name":"Rossmann","initials":"MG"}]}]}
